# Inspiration
.pull-left[
.left[
- I wanted to make a typical scientific journal multipanel plot
  + This proved to be suprisingly difficult, as it was hard to add a typical chatty multipanel text legend at the bottom
- This started as an RStudio Community question
- lots of discussion, sent twitter batsignal to Claus Wilke
- Ended up on Stack Overflow, with a solve from Claus
- Here I am sharing the solution

# Multipanel Plots

.left[
- Feel free to join in with the CRAN or dev versions
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("patchwork")
remotes::install_github("thomasp85/patchwork")
```
- make sure you have {tidyverse}, {patchwork}, and {ggtext} packages installed 
- library() all 3 packages
- Details at the {patchwork} packagedown site: <br>
https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com

- Take 60 seconds to install, library, and explore

# Motivation for Multipanel Plots

---

class:  center, top

# Why Do This?

.left[
1. To group together conceptually-linked plots that explain different aspects of a dataset or experiment.

2. Because the high-impact journal that you want to publish in prefers printing on dead trees to HTML output, <br>and therefore only allows 5 figures per manuscript.

  + And they require a minimum of 20 figures worth of data for a manuscript to be worthy of being sent out for review. 

  + So you are going to jam 20 figures into 5 multipanel plots, for complicated reasons involving promotion and tenure.

3. Did I mention that the academic-journal-industrial complex is an unfortunate relic of the 1870s?

## What Patchwork Can Do For You
.left[
- Start with Single (related) Plots
- Use a simple user interface to combine them
- Arrange at will in rows and columns
- Nesting included

## Preparing data for 4 dummy plots
.left[
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Library calls
library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext)
library(patchwork)

# make dummy figures
d1 <- runif(500)
d2 <- rep(c("Treatment", "Control"), each=250)
d3 <- rbeta(500, shape1=100, shape2=3)
d4 <- d3 + rnorm(500, mean=0, sd=0.1)
plotData <- data.frame(d1, d2, d3, d4)
```

## Single Plots, Plot 1 through Plot 4
.left[
```{r p1, eval=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(data=plotData) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=d3, y=d4)) + labs(tag = "A") +
  theme(plot.background = 
          element_rect(color='black'))

p2 <- ggplot(data=plotData) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=d2, y=d1, fill=d2))+
  theme(legend.position="none") + labs(tag = "B") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(color='black'))

p3 <- ggplot(data=plotData) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=d1, color=I("black"), fill=I("orchid"))) + labs(tag = "C") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(color='black'))

p4 <- ggplot(data=plotData) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=d3, color=I("black"), fill=I("goldenrod"))) + labs(tag = "D") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(color='black'))

# Panel A: Scatterplot

```{r p1-out, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(data=plotData) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=d3, y=d4)) + labs(tag = "A") +
  theme(plot.background = 
          element_rect(color='black'))
p1
```

## Panel B: Boxplot
```{r p2-out, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
p2 <- ggplot(data=plotData) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=d2, y=d1, fill=d2))+ labs(tag = "B") +

p4 <- ggplot(data=plotData) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=d3, color=I("black"), fill=I("goldenrod"))) + labs(tag = "D") +

## Now Combine These Plots into a Multipanel Plot

---

class:  center, top

## Use  |  to Combine Plots in a row!
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=10}
p1 | p2 | p3 | p4
```

---

class:  center, top

## Use  /  to Combine Plots in a Column!
```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=3}
p1 / p2 / p3 / p4 
```
---

class:  center, top

## Use  +  to Combine Plots in a 2 x 2 Grid!
```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
p1 + p2 + p3 + p4
```
---

class:  center, top

## Make More Complex Multipanel Plots with Nesting!
```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
p1 / (p2 | (p3/p4))
```

## This is Great, but How to Add a Combined Legend?
```{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=10, echo=FALSE}
(p1) / (p2 | (p3/p4))
```

## The Quest to Add a Combined Legend

---

class:  center, top

## Now Add the Legend - Attempt 1 with textGrob
.left[
- Not great
]
---

class:  center, top

## Now Add the Legend - Attempt 2 with ggtext caption
.left[
- Nesting!
]
---

class:  center, top

## Now Add the Legend - Attempt 3 with ggtext textbox_grob
.left[
- Odd spacing
- Turns out each row set to equal height
]
---

class:  center, top

## Now Add the Legend - Attempt 4 with ggtext plot_annotation
.left[
- Close with funky margins (narrower plot_annotation)
- turns out that this inherits margins from plot margins above - now applied to the caption
- can assign negative left and right margins (5.5 pt) to counteract the default plot margins.
]
---

class:  center, top

## Now Add the Legend - Attempt 5 - Solution!
.left[
- Can assign negative left and right margins (5.5 pt) to fix.
- Achievement unlocked!
]

class:  inverse, center, top

## Lessons Learned
.left[
- The #rstats community is awesome
- Use reprex to ask questions on RSC and SO
- Lots of people are willing to help if you can come up with a *minimal* reproducible example and<br>can state your question (and your end goal) clearly
